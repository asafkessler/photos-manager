# photos-manager
This project combines a java and python project to let you manager your photos and movies from different platforms and memory drives. Go check it out!

So THE MAIN THING this program does , it helps you get a quick managment tool for all your photos from different memory drives.
1) First, it lets you define diff paths to drivers connected to your computer.
2) Then it asks you to give a new location and name for all the videos (.mp4 files) and the photos (cr2 , jpg , png). 
3) In the end, it moves all the files to the specified folder (per file type). For a cool ending , if you wish to get all your ex's photos out of your memory drives it let you do some cool face recognition filters on your photos. ;)
